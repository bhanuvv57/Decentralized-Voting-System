# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based solution for conducting transparent, tamper-proof elections. It allows users to vote for a predefined list of candidates, ensuring that votes are immutable and transparent. With this system, election results are recorded on the blockchain, guaranteeing fairness and reducing the risk of manipulation.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Decentralized Voting System is to enable a secure and reliable election process that is free from fraud. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to provide a system that allows for public verification of votes while maintaining voter privacy and election transparency.

## Key Features
- **Secure Voting Process**: All votes are immutable and cannot be altered once cast.
- **Transparency**: Voters can check the current results at any time during the election.
- **Voting Duration**: The contract has a set duration after which voting is automatically closed.
- **Owner Control**: The contract owner has the ability to close the voting and declare the winner.
- **Event Logging**: Each vote cast is logged on the blockchain for transparency and accountability.

## Future Scope
- **Anonymous Voting**: Implement cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that the voterâ€™s identity is hidden.
- **Ranked-Choice Voting**: Add support for ranked-choice voting in future versions to allow more flexible election processes.
- **Scalability**: The contract can be optimized to handle larger sets of candidates and more voters in future versions.
- **Tokenization**: Add features to allow voting via tokens or a decentralized identity system to further decentralize the platform.
